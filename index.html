  <p>This morning I woke up to dozens of messages from students who had read an article titled ”Please Don’t Learn to Code.”</p>

But no – this was a <a href=""> brand new Tech Crunch article </a> of the same name, which echoed Atwood’s assertion that encouraging everyone to learn programming is like encouraging everyone to learn plumbing.</p>
